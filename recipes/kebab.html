        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice,
                 or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 ½ pounds boneless,
                 skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
            <li>4 long metal skewers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a shallow dish, 
                whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced 
                garlic, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper
                . Add your chosen protein (such as chunks of lamb
                , beef, chicken, or shrimp) and toss to coat 
                evenly. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator 
                for at least 30 minutes, 
                or up to 2 hours for deeper flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak the Skewers:</strong> If using wooden skewers, 
                soak them in water for at least 30 minutes 
                to prevent them from burning on the grill.</li>
            <li><strong>Thread the Kebabs:</strong> Remove the marinated 
                protein from the refrigerator. Thread 
                the pieces onto the skewers, alternating with
                 chunks of bell peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes,
                 or any other desired vegetables.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Grill:</strong> Prepare your grill 
                for direct grilling over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill the Kebabs:</strong> Place the threaded kebabs on 
                the preheated grill grates. Grill for 8-12
                 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked through 
                and the vegetables are tender and lightly charred.</li>
        </ol>
